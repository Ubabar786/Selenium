KEYS performs keyboard operations:
locate  the web Element
and send  keys(Keys.ENTER/TAB/ESCAPE/DELETE)
Use Case:

if a user story requires to enter key operation
or you can also use KEYS.DELETE to delete if clear command does not work

Action class allows us to do operations such as mimicking mouse operations:
Hover over
Drag and drop
Right click (ContextClick)
Double click
Simple click
etc

Use built when calling multiple methods in Actions class

The build() method in Selenium is used to create a composite action
that contains all the actions gathered which are ready to be performed.
The perform() method is used to execute the chain of actions which are built using the
Action build method.

USAGE:
1) Declare the instance
                  Actions action=new Actions(driver);
2) action.ContextClick(WebElement).perform();
3) another way to duse Actions class - use built() method when calling multiple methods in a row:
                  action.clickAndHold(draggable).moveToElement(droppable).release().build().perform();
