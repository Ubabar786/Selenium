Selenium review:
1) Initiate the instance of the WebDriver
2) driver.get("url"); - doesn't keep history - waits for whole page to load
   driver.navigate.to("url"); - keeps history, back forward and refresh - doesn't wait for whole page to load
   navigate.refresh(); - refresh the page
   navigate.back(); - go back one step
   navigate.forward(); - go forward one step
3) driver.quit(); - quit is going to close the whole browser
   driver.close(); - close is going to close the current window
4) driver.manage().window().maximize(); - maximise the window
   driver.getTitle(); - get the title
   driver.getCurrentUrl(); - get the URL of the website

- Locators are there available to us in selenium to help us locate the WebElement that we need
1. ID
2. Name
3. Class
4. Linktext
5. Partial linktext
6. Xpath
7. Css
8. Tagname
- We have a variety of locators so that we can choose the one that fits our criteria and available
  to us in the DOM to access the element.
