Waits:
Thread.sleep ---> disadvantages:
1) It is going to wait even if the element has been found for the mentioned duration, which makes out code slower.

Implicit Wait:
- Whenever we are waiting for the element to be found, we use implicit wait.
1) Implicit wait is going to wait until "THE WEBELEMENT IS FOUND".
a) if the element is found, it will end the wait time and move on
b) if the element is not found, (in duration of time out) it will return us with an exception
- Syntax: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
- 20 seconds: Max wait time

Explicit Wait:
- We use explicit wait until the condition is fulfilled
1) Explicit wait is going to wait until th webelement fulfils the condition
a) as soon as thr condition is fulfilled it moves on to the NEXT line of code
b) if the condition is NOT fulfilled (in the duration of time out) it will give an exception
- Syntax: WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait (driver, Duration.ofSeconds(20));
wait.until(ExpectedConditions. "THE CONDITION FOR WHICH YOU WANT TO WAIT" (The WebElement)
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath("//button[test()='Enabled']"));
